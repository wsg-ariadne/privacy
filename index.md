Privacy Policy
==============

This Privacy Policy explains how the Ariadne research team ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our browser extension ("Extension").

## Overview of Functionality

The Extension communicates with a remote server (“Server”), which is responsible for performing the machine learning classification (“Classification”) and managing the deceptive design reports (“Report,” “Reports”), submitted by users like you.

To notify you of any possible deceptive design patterns on the pages you visit, the Extension works by getting the URL of the web page that you are viewing and checking that URL against a database of sites reported to use deceptive design patterns. When there is no match for a URL, the Extension performs automatic Classification by:

1. Looking for candidate cookie banner elements (“Candidate,” “Candidates”) on the web page;
2. Taking a screen capture (“Screenshot,” “Screenshots”) of the first matching Candidate whose text contains any of the words “cookies,” “consent,” or “tracker,” all of which are words usually present in cookie banner text;
3. Extracting the text present in the Candidate;
4. Sending the Screenshot and the extracted text to the Server for Classification.

Candidates are elements that float and do not move (i.e., a CSS `position` value of `sticky`, `absolute`, or `fixed`, and a positive non-zero `z-index` value), and are thus candidates for being cookie banners.
Collection of Information
We take your privacy seriously. When you use our Extension, we collect, but not store, the following information:

- The URLs of the web pages that you visit;
- Screenshots and text content of Candidates detected on the web pages that you visit.

When you submit a Report using the Extension, either through the Thumbs Up button, Thumbs Down button, “There is deceptive design on this page” button, or the “No de we additionally collect and store the following information:

- The URL of the web page being reported;
- A description of the deceptive design pattern that you are reporting, if present.

As part of the basic functionalities of the Extension and the Server software, which includes logging and maintenance, we may also collect and store the following information:

- The time and date of your visits;
- The browser you're using;
- The operating system you're using;
- Your IP address.

The Extension does not require you to log in or to otherwise identify yourself before use. All of the above information, including any Reports you might submit, is collected anonymously and is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

Any Screenshots submitted to the server are never stored past the Classification step, as described in Overview of Functionality.

## Use of Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide you with the basic functionality of the Extension;
- Improve our Extension's functionality and performance;

We do not sell or rent information to third parties. However, we may share information with third-party service providers who help us operate our Extension or improve our products and services.

We may also share collected information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal requirement.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your information, as no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
